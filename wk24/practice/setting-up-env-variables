environment variables help set-up variables in code that varies from one environment to the other( dev, staging, production )

these include port number, db connection parameters

environment variables are made available in Node script on 'process.env'

setting up environment variable on development machines is usually an overkill

the 'dotenv' package helps set up variable directly on 'process.env'

the .env package facilitates the loading of environment variables from a .env file into the process.env object.

run 'npm i dotenv' to install the dotenv package

require('dotenv').config() is used to load and configure the environment variables defined in the .env file into the process.env object.
