a web service is an interface that web application client and server used for exchanging application state

REST - REpresentational State Transfer

communication is over any stateless protocol, usually HTTP

stateless means one message has no bearing on the next one

REST promotes loose coupling of client with server, making changes on either end easy

central concept in REST is a resource




resource: an entity in an application e.g. restaurant, a list of restaurants
          uniquely addressable using a URL ( e.g. http://localhost:3000/api/v1/restaurants )




representation of a resource:

a resource state is the data associated with it. it is transferred to the client in some format. e.g. JSON, XML
