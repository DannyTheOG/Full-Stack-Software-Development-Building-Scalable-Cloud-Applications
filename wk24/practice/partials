HTML files have parts which they share - head section, navigation menu etc.

to reduce repetition of such code and create a common piece of such HTML, that other files can include we have partials

this also makes it a simple affair to make changes to navigation menu, etc.



making use of partials:

create 3 EJS files with head section, navigation menu, and footer section

replace the head, menu and footer parts, by including the partials.
  syntax: <%- include( partialPath, data ) -%>
