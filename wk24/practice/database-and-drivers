we make DB queries from our application to store and retrieve data

drivers are packages that help us make these queries from the application

drivers convert method calls to DB requests( in appropriate DB protocol ) and send them to the DB server

once the response comes from the DB server, they return it to the code calling the method/callback function

MongoDB provides an official driver for Node.js

we shall use 'Mongoose' that wraps over the MongoDB driver for Node.js and provides many useful features ( schema validation, etc )

'Mongoose' is a popular package in Express.js that provides an Object Data Modeling layer for MongoDB, which simplifies all the interactions with MongoDB databases by providing a structured way to define models, maintain data, and perform database operations.
