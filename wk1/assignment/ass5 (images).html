    <h1>We're the Millers</h1>

    <p>We're the Millers is a 2013 American comedy film directed by Rawson M. Thurber and starring Jennifer Aniston,
        Jason Sudeikis, Emma Roberts, Will Poulter, Nick Offerman, Kathryn Hahn, Molly Quinn, and Ed Helms. The film's
        screenplay was written by Bob Fisher, Steve Faber, Sean Anders, and John Morris, based on a story by Fisher and
        Faber. The plot follows a small-time pot dealer (Sudeikis) who convinces his neighbors to help him by pretending
        to be his family in order to smuggle drugs from Mexico into the United States.</p>

    <p>The film was released on August 7, 2013, by New Line Cinema through Warner Bros. Pictures. Despite mixed reviews,
        it was a box office success, grossing $270 million worldwide against a $37 million budget during its theatrical
        run. It was nominated for four People's Choice Awards, and six MTV Movie Awards, winning two.</p>

    <h2>Plot</h2>

    <p>In Denver, low-level marijuana dealer David Clark is robbed of his money and stash, some of which he owes to
        his
        drug supplier and college acquaintance Brad Gurdlinger. Gurdlinger forces him to smuggle marijuana from
        Mexico
        to clear his debt. Realizing that one man attempting to get through customs would be suspicious, David hires
        his
        neighbors—a stripper stage-named Rose; local runaway Casey; and naïve, recently abandoned teenager Kenny—to
        pose
        as his wife, daughter, and son respectively, dubbing themselves the "Millers".</p>

    <p>When the Millers reach the compound, they learn that the amount of marijuana they are picking up is not "a
        smidge" as Gurdlinger described it, but two tons. The Millers are stopped several times on their way back to
        the
        border, but get by on bribery and sheer luck. Because of the extra load from the marijuana on the RV, one of
        the
        radiator hoses breaks. The Fitzgeralds (consisting of father Don, mother Edie, and daughter Melissa), a
        family
        vacationing in an RV whom the Millers had encountered at the border, catch up to them and tow their RV to a
        repair shop. On the way to the shop, they learn that Don is a DEA agent, alarming them. Kenny develops a
        crush
        on Melissa. After Kenny reveals that he has never kissed a girl, Casey and Rose give him kissing lessons;
        Melissa sees them and assumes they are in an incestual relationship.</p>

    <p>It turns out that Gurdlinger misled David, and that he plans to steal the marijuana from cartel boss Pablo
        Chacon. The next day, when the Millers head to the shop to pick up the RV, Chacon, and his henchman,
        One-Eye,
        wait for them and prepare to kill them. The Millers tell Chacon they are not a real family and did not know
        they
        were stealing from him. Rose is given a chance to prove that she is a stripper by dancing, and when she gets
        close to Chacon, she turns a steam vent onto him. The Millers then escape in the RV, with Kenny behind the
        wheel. Due to Kenny's erratic driving, the RV veers off the highway and crashes. In the commotion, a
        tarantula
        that snuck aboard the RV in Mexico crawls up Kenny's leg and bites his testicles.</p>

    <p>After Kenny has a severe allergic reaction to the bite, the Millers head to the hospital. This setback
        further
        delays the delivery of the drugs, but David renegotiates with Gurdlinger for a fee of $500,000 on the
        condition
        that he arrives that night. When Kenny is finally released from the hospital, David rushes him to the RV in
        a
        wheelchair and accidentally tips him over. In the ensuing argument, David inadvertently reveals how much he
        is
        getting paid, in comparison to how little he offered to pay each of the others. Disgusted by the revelation,
        Rose, Casey, and Kenny part company with David. David drives away, leaving them at the local carnival.</p>

    <p>David regrets abandoning his companions and returns to the carnival. After David apologizes to Rose, Casey,
        and
        Kenny for being less than honest with them, the three agree to rejoin him as he drives the rest of the way
        home.
        As the Millers make their way to the RV, One-Eye discovers them and is about to shoot them when Don comes
        out of
        his camper and subdues him. Chacon then comes around the corner with Melissa held at gunpoint and is about
        to
        kill them all; however, he is momentarily distracted by the 4th of July fireworks, and David and Kenny
        subdue
        him. Kenny kisses Melissa, prompting David to kiss Rose. Don arrests Chacon but lets the Millers leave in
        gratitude because they saved Melissa.</p>

    <p>Gurdlinger reveals that he never intended to pay David for smuggling the marijuana. When David delivers the
        marijuana to Gurdlinger, DEA agents arrive and take him into custody based on a tip from David. Don tells
        David
        that he and any witnesses of the crime will be placed into witness protection until the trial of Gurdlinger
        and
        Chacon. Later, the Millers - now under witness protection together - are seen together at a suburban house
        with
        marijuana plants growing in the backyard.</p>
