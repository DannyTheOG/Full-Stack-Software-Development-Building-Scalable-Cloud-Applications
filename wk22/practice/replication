Replication is a process of maintaining multiple copies of the same data in different servers

In MongoDB, a replica set is a group of servers that maintain the same dataset

While replication provides many benefits, there's also some concerns to keep in mind when configuring and managing replica sets.

The primary node is responsible for write operations, while the secondary nodes are read-only replicas that provide data redundancy and assist with read scaling.
