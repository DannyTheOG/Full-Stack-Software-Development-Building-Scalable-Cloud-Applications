Replication is a process of maintaining multiple copies of the same data in different servers

In MongoDB, a replica set is a group of servers that maintain the same dataset

While replication provides many benefits, there's also some concerns to keep in mind when configuring and managing replica sets.

The primary node is responsible for write operations, while the secondary nodes are read-only replicas that provide data redundancy and assist with read scaling.


Replica Set Members

Primary
  handles all writes
  only one primary node per replica set


Secondary
  replicates data from the primary
  can serve read operations


Arbiter
  a member of the replica set that does not store a copy of the data
  participates in election of a new primary if current primary fails


Delayed Member (secondary)
  lags behind the primary by a specific amount of time
  can provide backup in case of accident data deletion/corruption


Hidden Member (secondary)
  does not appear in the replica set status
  used for running analytics queries/performing backups



Replication Process

1. Write operation
2. Replication to secondary servers
3. Confirm replication to primary server ( replSetGetStatus )
4. Election process (if primary fails)
