MongoDB uses Sharding to meet the growing demands for data storage on multiple machines( horizontal scaling)

In sharding process, horizontal scaling, also called scaling out, is a method that is used to address the need for increased capacity and performance.

replica set is a cluster of MongoDB servers that store the same data set.

a sharded cluster is a cluster of MongoDB servers that store a large amount of data across multiple shards

a shard is a set of servers that store a subset of the total data set based on a shard key

a shard key is a set of fields that MongoDB uses to determine which shard should store a particular piece of data



benefits include:
  scalability: partition the data across multiple servers( horizontal scaling)
  improved performance
  high availability
  fault tolerance
  auto balancing
