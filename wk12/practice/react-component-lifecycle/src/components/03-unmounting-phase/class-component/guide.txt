NB: componentWillUnmount() is a react class component lifecycle method called just before the component is removed from the DOM.

to understand the unmounting phase, we need to go in Dev Tools by clicking on inspect option, then click on components.

for ClassComponentExample, select the 'UnmountingPhase1' and you will see value of the state 'deleteSampleComponent' as 'true'; make it false by unchecking it.

so the 'SampleComponent' will get deleted and you will see alert message while it is getting unmounted.
