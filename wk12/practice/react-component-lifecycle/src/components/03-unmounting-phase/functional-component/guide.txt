NB: componentWillUnmount() is a react class component lifecycle method called just before the component is removed from the DOM.

to understand the unmounting phase, we need to go in Dev Tools by clicking on inspect option, then click on components.

for FunctionalComponentExample, select the 'UnmountingPhase2' and you will change the value of the hook State as 'false'

as it is false so the component is not mounted and you don't see anything on the webpage

make it true by checking the State value, the webpage will be updated when the component gets mounted

make it false again by unchecking the State value, the webpage will be updated when the component gets unmounted
