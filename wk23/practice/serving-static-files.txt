static files may be many in number - it is impractical to set up individual routes for them

express static file server is a middleware that can check if the incoming URL matches any path within
a set of folders that have static assets

if a matching path is found, it serves the file as response, else it does nothing

instead of creating individual routes for each static asset, after installing the static assets and copying them into the public directory

import 'path' library to the main project index.js file

add app.use( express.static( path.join( process.cwd(), 'public') ) )
