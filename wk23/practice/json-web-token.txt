JWT serves as an open standard, outlined in RFC 7519, offering a secure and self-contained method for exchanging information between entities in the form of a JSON object

This data can be relied upon and authenticated due to its digital signature.

JWTs can be signed either through a secret using the HMAC algorithm or with a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA

it consists of three parts:
    header: a JSON object that contains information about the type of token and algorithm used for signing/encrypting the token

    payload: another JSON object with claims about the user (e.g., user ID, username, expiration time)

    signature: the encoded header, the encoded payload, and a secret key. It then applies the specified signing algorithm to create the signature

JWT = header(base64-url encoded) + payload + signature;


advantages:
  stateless authentication:  allow for stateless authentication, eliminating the need for servers to store session information and enhancing scalability

  efficient cross-domain authentication:  transmitted between different domains, making them suitable for microservices architectures and third-party service integrations

  versatile information exchange: efficient way to transmit user information, roles, and permissions securely

  decentralized identity management: conveying user identity and permissions without relying on a centralized authentication server
