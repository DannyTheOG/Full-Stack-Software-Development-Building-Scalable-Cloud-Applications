the response object has various methods for sending different types of responses


res.write(), res.end() - these are simply part of the NodeJs API. Express response objects simply add more methods like;

res.sent() - sends HTML response ( Content-Type: text/html header is sent )

res.json() - sends JSON response ( Content-Type: application/json header is sent ) - useful to build API

res.render() to send HTML response generated by templating engines - useful for generating dynamic HTML pages (pages whose content depend on dynamic data)

res.redirect() - to send a redirect response to the client ( achieved using a Location: url header )
